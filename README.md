Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, we make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. We write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. We also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
